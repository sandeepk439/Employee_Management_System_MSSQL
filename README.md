# Employee_Management_System_MSSQL
# I have created this SQL Server-based project to manage employee information, department structures, Employee salary information, performance rating and attendance information. This database provides an efficient way to store and retrieve essential employee data and generate insights through views and reports.
# I have created a report in Excel file for this database. 
# First i have created a structure for the database which includes Table name and column names and their data types.
# Then i have inserted few data in the tables as for the requirement.
# Then i have created few stored procedures.
# Then i have created Views.
# Then i have created Triggers.
# Then i have used indexing for performance tuning.
# For database security i have defined roles.

# For all these i have created a Excel file.
